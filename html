        <blockquote class="blockquote"></blockquote><p><big>Music is the arrangement of sound to create some combination of form, harmony, melody, rhythm, or otherwise expressive
        content. Music is generally agreed to be a cultural universal that is present in all human societies.
        Definitions of music vary widely in substance and approach. While scholars agree that music is defined by a small number of specific elements, there is no consensus as to what these necessary elements are. Music is often
        characterized as a highly versatile medium for expressing human creativity</big></p>
        <p><big>Listening to music is a common means of entertainment. The culture surrounding music extends into areas of <kbd>academic
        study, journalism, philosophy, psychology, and therapy</kbd>. The music industry includes songwriters, performers, sound
        engineers, producers, tour organizers, distributors of instruments, accessories, and publishers of sheet music and
        recordings. Technology facilitating the recording and reproduction of music has historically included <code> music,</code><code>
        microphones,</code> <code>phonographs,</code> and <code>tape machines,</code> with playback of digital musics being a common use for <mark><big class="text-muted">MP3 players, CD
